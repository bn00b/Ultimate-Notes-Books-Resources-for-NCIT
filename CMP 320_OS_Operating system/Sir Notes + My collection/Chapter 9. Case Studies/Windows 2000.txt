-Memory Management in linux
	-Tries to avoid segmentatation
	-Uses Paging
		- 4K page size
		- Three level page table
		- 64 bit address space

		On x86 processors:	only two level page tables, paging supported in hardware, TLB provided as well

		First 2 MB of memory is reserved for PC architecture and for OS text and data. The rest is available for paging.
		Also implements mechanism for allocating contiguous page frames. Tackles with the fragmentation by Buddy System algorithm.
		slab allocator for dealing
			with small memory area allocation
